# Words With Friends Example Algorithms

This is a sample application that illustrates some example
algorithms for validating and scoring words with friends moves.

The application utilizes the following assumptions:
+ all words are valid in terms of letter distributions
+ all words are present in the dictionary
+ submitted moves are added in the correct player rotation
+ blank(wildcard) letters are not allowed
